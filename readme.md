## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/lopezrunco/react-themes.git
   ```

2. **Install TypeScript (if not already installed):**
    This project uses TypeScript for type-checking and enhanced development. If you haven't installed TypeScript globally, you can do so via npm (Node.js package manager). Run the following command:
   ```bash
   npm install -g typescript
   ```

3. **Navigate to a Theme Directory:**
    Once you've cloned the repository and installed TypeScript, navigate to a specific theme directory of your choice:
   ```bash
   cd react-themes/theme-name
   ```

4. **Install Dependencies:**
   Before running the theme, install the required dependencies using npm:
    ```bash
   npm install
   ```

5. **Run the Theme:**
   After installing the dependencies, start the development server for the selected theme:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    This command will compile the TypeScript code and launch a local development server. Open your web browser and go to http://localhost:5173 (or another specified port) to view the theme in action.
